# Yep
Just scripts to keep me from having to do math <br>
Generally they all display nicely. (Pretty Print)<br>
# affinedecryptor
Feed it a string, and the decryption key k = (a, b) <br> 
# aMODnOrderFinder
Give it the number for n, it prints out all the orders of a mod n that exist (satisfy gcd(a, n)=1), and tells you the primitive roots. <br>
# charstats
Feed it a string, it will give you the frequency of each letter as percentages. <br> 
# extendedEuclid
Feed it two numbers, a and b. I think a should be bigger than b, but I am just working off two examples given to me, not the proofs. It does the Extended Euclid algorithm, and finds the mutual multiplicative inverses. <br>
# modexp
Solves for x for equations in the format: <br>
a^x = b mod c <br>
# phifinder 
Find all integers n between 0 ≤ n < m that are relatively prime to m. <br>
Euler’s phi function
